bag2mat.py :
    convert bag files to matlab arrays (WORKING)
    Before running, delete the existing bagfile_data.mat, the program 
    does not override the existing file
    file will be saved as : ./mat_files/<input>

offline_train.py :
    When asked, input file should be : 'mat_files/<mat_file>', 
    including the single quotes
    
    trained data will be saved in as : mat_files/<data_files>
    !!!When asked for max laser range, input the maximum range scanned 
    during the recording, not the maximum range at which you want to train
    
    changed limit check to limit-1
    
    fr_index should be increased even on empty scan receive
    data is saved outside the main for loop, no chance of not saving
    
    classifier was being created from scratch each time the program ran
    
    colors cycle with %2 to avoid crashing
    
    for dataset 'cinema16' timewindow of 20 frames will cause the training
    to crash
    
gtxs:
    files are coded as such: a_b_c_d_e_f.png where
    a: filename
    b: p<number of obstacles>
    c: h<number of humans><m(oving)/s(tatic)>
    d: annotation of cluster (h/o)
    e: 2d/3d 
    f: identifier for similar conditions
